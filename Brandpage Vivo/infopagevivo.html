            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p><b>Vivo Communication Technology Co. Ltd.</b>, stylised as vivo, is a Chinese technology company headquartered in Dongguan, Guangdong that designs and develops 
                smartphones, smartphone accessories, software and online services. The company develops software for its phones, distributed through its V-Appstore, with 
                iManager included in their proprietary, Android-based operating system, Funtouch OS. Vivo is an independent company and develops its own products. It has 
                10,000 employees, with research and development centers in Shenzhen, Guangdong, and Nanjing, Jiangsu.<br><br>
                In October 2015, Vivo became the title sponsor of the Indian Premier League (IPL) under a two-year deal starting in the 2016 season. In July 2017, 
                the deal was extended until 2022. However, in response to the 2020 border skirmishes between India and China, the Board of Control for Cricket in India 
                (BCCI) was criticised in India for allowing a Chinese company to be the title sponsor of the league. Vivo and BCCI mutually agreed to suspend the deal 
                for the 2020 season, with a clause to resume it next season.<br><br>
                In June 2017, Vivo reached a sponsorship deal with FIFA to become the official smartphone brand of the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups. The company also 
                signed a deal with UEFA as an official partner of the UEFA Euro 2020 and UEFA Euro 2024, and became a title sponsor of India's Pro Kabaddi.<br><br>
                Vivo has a sponsorship deal with the NBA in China, with Golden State Warriors player Stephen Curry. He endorses the brand in China and the Philippines.<br><br>
