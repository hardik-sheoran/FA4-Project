            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>
                The "MI" in our logo stands for “Mobile Internet”. It also has other meanings, including "Mission Impossible", because Xiaomi faced many challenges that
                had seemed impossible to defy in our early days.
                Xiaomi was founded in 2010 by serial entrepreneur Lei Jun based on the vision “innovation for everyone”.
                We believe that high-quality products built with cutting-edge technology should be made accessible to everyone.
                We create remarkable hardware, software, and Internet services for and with the help of our Mi fans. We incorporate
                their feedback into our product range, which currently includes Mi and Redmi smartphones, Mi TVs and set-top boxes,
                Mi routers, and Mi Ecosystem products including smart home products, wearables and other accessories. 
                With presence in over 30 countries and regions, Xiaomi is expanding its footprint across the world to
                become a global brand.
